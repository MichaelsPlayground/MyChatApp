Dear Yannick, 
this is just a note and NOT AN ISSUE. It could be a good idea to place some information in a readme.md file of your repository and inform developers what services need to get setup on Google's Firebase console.

As the "google-services.json" file is missing (what is understandable) in the repo I cannot test the app and it is not as easy as expected to setup all Firebase services in a correct manner. 

Thanks for your understanding and greetings from Germany
Michael
